# 3.4 Statistical inference

## Read the data

Data are in the *child.iq* directory of the ARM_Data download-- you might have
to change the path I use below to reflect the path on your computer.

```{r}
# I had to import foreign to get access to read.dta
library("foreign")
kidiq <- read.dta("../../ARM_Data/child.iq/kidiq.dta")

# I won't attach kidiq-- i generally don't attach to avoid confusion(s)
#attach(kidiq)
```

Load the *arm* library-- see the Chapter 3.1 notebook if you need help.

```{r}
library("arm")
```

## Regression-- to demonstrate reports of fit, Pg38

```{r}
fit.3 <- lm(kidiq$kid_score ~ kidiq$mom_hs + kidiq$mom_iq)
```

## Display, Pg 38

Just right?

```{r}
display(fit.3)
```

## Print, Pg 39

Too little information?

```{r}
print(fit.3)
```

## Summary, Pg 38

Too much information?

```{r}
summary(fit.3)
```
